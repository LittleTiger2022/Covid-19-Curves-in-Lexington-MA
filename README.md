# Covid-19-Curves-in-Lexington-MA

At the begining of covid-19 pandamic, there is no online visualization website to help people minitoring covid-19 cases locally in the town I am living. So, I set up this website and shared with others to help them know the recent situation.

These plots were made from python visulization packages (panel + bokeh).

The online website is host freely by using heroku service.
